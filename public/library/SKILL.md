# Cortex Library Skill

Sync your agent memory files to a **Cortex Library** knowledge graph. Upload documents, search your knowledge base, and ask AI-powered questions with agentic deep research capabilities.

All memory files are organized within a single dedicated collection (default: **OpenClaw**). If this collection doesn't exist, the skill automatically creates it.

## Skill Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **SKILL.md** (this file) | Main skill documentation |
| **HEARTBEAT.md** | Periodic sync tasks and memory upload workflow |
| [references/API.md](references/API.md) | Full API reference (60+ endpoints) |
| [references/SYNC.md](references/SYNC.md) | Detailed sync workflow and troubleshooting |
| **scripts/sync.sh** | Bash sync script |
| **scripts/sync_bulk.py** | Python bulk sync script |
| **scripts/sync_memory.js** | Node.js sync script |
| **state/credentials.example.json** | Example credentials file |

---

## First-Time Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Base URL and API Key

You need **both** a base URL and an API key.

Ask your human to provide:

1. **Base URL** - The full URL to their Cortex Library instance (e.g., `https://library.example.com`)
2. **API Key** - From `YOUR_BASE_URL/admin` -> API Keys, with **READ** and **MANAGE** permissions

### Step 2: Configure Credentials

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills/library/state
cat > ~/.openclaw/skills/library/state/credentials.json << 'EOF'
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
  "base_url": "YOUR_BASE_URL_HERE",
  "collection_id": null
}
EOF
```

### Step 3: Validate the Connection

```bash
API_KEY=$(cat ~/.openclaw/skills/library/state/credentials.json | jq -r '.api_key')
API_BASE=$(cat ~/.openclaw/skills/library/state/credentials.json | jq -r '.base_url')

if [ -z "$API_KEY" ] || [ "$API_KEY" = "null" ] || [ -z "$API_BASE" ] || [ "$API_BASE" = "null" ]; then
  echo "Missing credentials. Both api_key and base_url are required."
  exit 1
fi

curl -s "$API_BASE/health" -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY"
```

Expected: `{"status": "healthy", "neo4j_connected": true, "version": "2.0.0"}`

### Step 4: Find or Create Collection

```bash
API_KEY=$(cat ~/.openclaw/skills/library/state/credentials.json | jq -r '.api_key')
API_BASE=$(cat ~/.openclaw/skills/library/state/credentials.json | jq -r '.base_url')
COLLECTION_NAME="OpenClaw"

COLLECTIONS=$(curl -s "$API_BASE/api/collections" -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY")
COLLECTION_ID=$(echo "$COLLECTIONS" | jq -r ".collections[] | select(.name == \"$COLLECTION_NAME\") | .id" | head -n1)

if [ -z "$COLLECTION_ID" ] || [ "$COLLECTION_ID" = "null" ]; then
  CREATE_RESULT=$(curl -s -X POST "$API_BASE/api/collections" \
    -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"name\": \"$COLLECTION_NAME\", \"description\": \"Memory files synced from agent\"}")
  COLLECTION_ID=$(echo "$CREATE_RESULT" | jq -r '.id')
fi

jq --arg cid "$COLLECTION_ID" '.collection_id = $cid' \
  ~/.openclaw/skills/library/state/credentials.json > ~/.openclaw/skills/library/state/credentials.json.tmp
mv ~/.openclaw/skills/library/state/credentials.json.tmp ~/.openclaw/skills/library/state/credentials.json
echo "Collection ID: $COLLECTION_ID"
```

## Memory Directories

Default memory locations scanned for sync:
- `~/.openclaw/memory/` - Primary memory storage
- `~/.openclaw/conversations/` - Conversation logs
- **QMD sessions**: `~/.openclaw/agents/main/qmd/sessions/` - When QMD is enabled

**Supported file types:** `.md`, `.txt`, `.json`

---

## Upload API

**CRITICAL:** Upload parameters (`collection_id`, `start_processing`) MUST be URL query parameters, NOT form fields:

```bash
# CORRECT:
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/api/upload?collection_id=$COLLECTION_ID&start_processing=true" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/file.md"

# WRONG (will not work):
# curl -X POST "$API_BASE/api/upload" -F "collection_id=$COLLECTION_ID" -F "file=@..."
```

### Single File Upload

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/api/upload?collection_id=$COLLECTION_ID&start_processing=true" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/memory.md"
```

### Bulk Upload (Recommended for Multiple Files)

1. Upload all files without processing:
```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/api/upload?collection_id=$COLLECTION_ID&start_processing=false" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/file.md"
```

2. Trigger batch processing:
```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/api/documents/process-pending" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY"
```

---

## Search & Ask

### Hybrid Search

Combines vector (0.5), keyword (0.3), and graph traversal (0.2) with cross-encoder reranking.

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/api/search" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "your search query", "top_k": 10}'
```

**Collection-scoped search** - add `"collection_id": "col_xxx"` to search within a specific collection.

### Ask AI (RAG Query)

Two modes available:
- **Chat mode** (speed): 2 research iterations, 1200 token answers
- **Deep Research mode** (quality): Up to 10 agentic iterations with reasoning, 4000 token answers

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/api/ask" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What do I know about topic X?", "mode": "speed"}'
```

**Streaming** - use `/api/ask/stream` for real-time SSE responses:
```bash
curl -N "$API_BASE/api/ask/stream" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Summarize what I know about machine learning"}'
```

SSE events: `content`, `sources`, `graph_context`, `thinking`, `sub_questions`, `retrieval`, `done`, `error`

## Knowledge Graph Features

Cortex Library builds a knowledge graph from your documents with:

- **Entity extraction** - 10 types: Person, Organization, Concept, Technology, Location, Event, Product, Document, System, Process
- **Relationship analysis** - 14 standard types with per-chunk and cross-document relationship discovery, confidence scoring (< 0.5 filtered)
- **Community detection** - Leiden/Louvain clustering with LLM-generated summaries
- **Entity deduplication** - Fuzzy matching (rapidfuzz) with merge/dismiss workflow
- **Graph visualization** - Interactive force-graph with dynamic expansion

### Pipeline (3 steps)

1. **Entity Extraction** - Per-document, with fuzzy entity resolution (85% Levenshtein)
2. **Relationship Analysis** - Cross-document, batched (120 entities/batch), supports incremental or rebuild
3. **Community Detection** - Weighted graph clustering with automatic summarization

---

## Upload Tracking

Files are tracked in `~/.openclaw/skills/library/state/uploaded_files.json` using SHA-256 hashes to avoid duplicates. Tracking is updated immediately after each upload to survive interruptions.

---

## Collections

Organize documents into logical groups. Each collection has its own scoped search and entity graph.

```bash
# List collections
curl "$API_BASE/api/collections" -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY"

# Create collection
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/api/collections" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My Collection", "description": "Description"}'
```

---

## Custom Inputs

Add knowledge manually without uploading files (Q&A pairs, text, markdown):

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/api/custom-input" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "qa", "question": "What is X?", "answer": "X is..."}'
```

---

## Authentication

All API requests require an API key via `X-API-Key` header.

**Permission levels:** `read` (search, view), `write` (upload, create), `delete` (remove), `admin` (full access including key management).

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Missing credentials | Ask human for both base URL and API key |
| 401 Unauthorized | API key invalid or expired, request a new one |
| Connection refused | Service may be down, retry later |
| Collection not found | Skill auto-creates the collection |
| Upload failed | File not tracked, retried on next sync |

---

## When to Sync

- **Automatic:** Every 4+ hours via heartbeat (see [HEARTBEAT.md](HEARTBEAT.md))
- **Manual:** When human says "sync memories" or before answering questions needing historical context
- **Don't sync:** Every few minutes, empty/temporary files, or files still being written

---

## Full API Reference

See [references/API.md](references/API.md) for the complete 60+ endpoint API reference.

## Detailed Sync Workflow

See [references/SYNC.md](references/SYNC.md) for complete sync scripts, QMD support, and troubleshooting.
